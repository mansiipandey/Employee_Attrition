## Project Overview

Employee attrition is a critical issue for organizations, as it impacts productivity, morale, and financial performance. This project uses a dataset to analyze employee attrition patterns and build predictive models to identify employees at risk of leaving. The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Data Description

The dataset used for this analysis includes various features related to employee demographics, job satisfaction, performance, and other factors. Key features include:

- Age
- Job Role
- Monthly Income
- Job Satisfaction
- Years at Company
- Attrition (target variable)

The dataset is available in the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you'll need to set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mansiipandey/Employee_Attrition.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Employee_Attrition
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook `Employee_Attrition_Analysis.ipynb` in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code). Follow the steps in the notebook to run the analysis and build predictive models.

```sh
jupyter notebook Employee_Attrition_Analysis.ipynb
```

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Building
6. Model Evaluation
7. Conclusions

## Results

The analysis includes several machine learning models to predict employee attrition. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate model performance. The results highlight the most important features influencing attrition and provide insights into how organizations can address employee retention.
